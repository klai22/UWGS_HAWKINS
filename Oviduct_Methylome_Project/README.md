#Processed and annotated WGBS data, generating methylomic profiles of chicken reproductive tissues; contributed to a global database (FAANG) facilitating genomic farming to combat egg shortages.
#Quantified proportions of differentially methylated regions amongst CpGislands and various genomic features across oviduct tissues.
#Conducted enrichment analysis to reveal the impact of DNA methylation on key biological pathways associated with healthy egg production.
#Facilitated development and execution of epigenomic-sequence data-analysis workflows.

#DMRAnalysis_Enrichment(hyperhypo).R : obtaining enrichement analysis results (repeating to isolate those that belong to hypermethylated and hypomethylated tissues)
#(HYPER/HYPO)EnrichmentFigures.R : After doing GO analysis, plotting results on a heatmap, repeating to further make 2 additional separate heatmaps for only hypermethylated and hypomethylated genes
#DMRAnalysis_mettype.R : plotting the proportions of DMRs when comparing each tissue
#homerannotation.R : plotting the distribution of DMRs amongst standard genetic elements & CpGisland genetic elements (HOMOR results) 
#CpGIslandAnalysis.R: plotting the distribution of DMRs amongst standard genetic elements & CpGisland genetic elements (HOMOR results) 
#CpGcontext.R : plotting (1) overall methylation dinucleotide context distributions across samples & (2) levels of CG methylation acorss each chromosome in each sample. 
#globalDMR.R : making a heatmap of DMR levels for each pairwise comparison of tissues.
